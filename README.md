# Project Description

In this project, I used React JS to create an application integrated with GIS (Geographic Information System) that provides the address of a clicked location on the map.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, follow these steps:

1. Visit [Geocode Maps](https://geocode.maps.co/) and register to obtain an API key.
2. Set your API key in the `accessKey.js` file.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```
